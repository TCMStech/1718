TCMS has a BYOD (bring your own device) policy that allows students to use their own devices at the direction of their instructor within the guidelines of school policies. These devices include laptops, tablets, smart phones, and e-readers. Please consult your handbook for policies and procedures in regards to technology use. We do the best that we can to provide a safe and engaging learning environment for your student.
