We are asking you for your continued cooperation in assisting us to control the spread of communicable diseases. Our goal is to make our school a healthy, safe place for both students and staff. We will call you immediately if your child becomes ill during school hours. You are expected to arrange for your child to be picked up AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE after receiving our call. Our school clinic is not equipped or staffed to handle ill children for long periods of time.

Please inform us IMMEDIATELY if telephone numbers or other information on your childâ€™s emergency card changes. The information on this card is vital for the safety and well being of your child.

WE ASK YOU NOT SEND YOUR CHILD TO SCHOOL IF ANY SIGNS/SYMPTOMS LISTED BELOW ARE PRESENT

1. Vomiting or diarrhea within past 24 hours
2. Fever within past 24 hours (100 degrees or higher WITHOUT the use of fever reducing medicine)
3. Sore/red throat
4. Persistent coughing or sneezing
5. Red watery eyes
6. Rash
7. Earache, drainage from ear
8. Excessive mucus from nose (runny nose), particularly greenish-yellow mucus

Your child may return to school as soon as ALL SIGN/SYMPTOM ARE GONE or when your physician provides a WRITTEN STATEMENT indicating your child is ready to return.

If your child has a communicable disease, please call and tell us the nature of the illness and when we can expect his/her return to school.
