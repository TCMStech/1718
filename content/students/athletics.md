Through involvement in our competitive athletic sports program at TCMS we aim for students to…

* Develop physical skills and fitness through regular practice.
* Develop an understanding of commitment and the value of dedicated practice.
* Embrace their interdependence and understand the need for team work as a pre-requisite for success.
* Develop leadership skills through distinct roles during the season.
* Trust and respect the value of good sportsmanship and practice it through their treatment of officials, peers, opponents, and spectators during activities.
* Have fun and use physical activity as a means of stress release.
* Demonstrate courage by taking appropriate risks with the aim of self growth.
* Refine existing skills and learn new ones.

Please remember to have your child turn in their Pre-Participation Physical before tryouts are held for the sport they are interested in trying out for. My hope is that the continued support from parents, student-athletes, coaches, and school personnel will make our competitive athletics a positive one in every way possible. For all those involved, TCMS thanks you for this. Good luck to all participants as we look forward to another great year!
