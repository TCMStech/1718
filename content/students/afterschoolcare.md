### Program Overview
Terrace Community Middle School (TCMS) Afterschool Program provides structured activities (snack time, study time and free time which includes arts, crafts, indoor and outdoor games, etc.) in a school-based setting. Our program begins as soon as school is dismissed and continues until 6:00 p.m. on all regular school days, including early dismissal days. Please note, however, that we will not offer this program on the LAST DAY OF SCHOOL. All students must be picked up at dismissal.

We strive to keep our staff ratio at 1:15. The cost of our program is $50 per week, or $10 per day.

### Application
A $40 non-refundable application/membership fee must accompany this application and Contact Information/Emergency Form.

### Payments
Payment can be made by check, money order, debit, charge card or by Paypal. No cash will be accepted. Payments are due the week services are rendered or either by payment in advance. This service is a privilege, and if payment is not received timely, this privilege can be revoked and you will have to make arrangements to have your child picked up timely following school dismissal. If there is a hardship, you need to speak with the principal or business manager to make other financial arrangements. A $25 fee will be charged for any returned checks. In accordance with the Student Handbook, if two checks are returned due to NSF, you will only be allowed to make payment by money order, debit, charge or PayPal.

### Holidays
The Afterschool Program will not be held on any non-student day which includes holidays, teacher planning days, etc. Please refer to the school calendar for these days.

### Dismissal/Authorized Persons
When an authorized person picks up your child, they MUST:

1.  Enter the program area.
2.  Show photo I.D
3.  Sign out the child every day

ONLY those persons listed on the child's emergency card will be authorized to pick up the child. No one else, including family members, is considered an authorized person. If there is any doubt, phone verification will be made to the child's parent before any child is released. In the event the parent cannot be reached, the child WILL NOT be released. Should any authorized person arrive to pick up a child and they appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, for the child's safety, staff may have no recourse but to contact the police and not allow the child to leave with that person. Please do not put staff in a position where they have to make this judgment call.

### Late Pick Up
It is important that you make arrangements for your child to be picked up no later than 6:00 p.m. A LATE FEE of $10 per 15 minute intervals will be assessed after 6:00 p.m. REPEATED LATENESS IS CAUSE FOR DISMISSAL FROM THE PROGRAM.

### Safety Procedures
Please note there will not be a nurse on the premises during the Afterschool Program. Children suffering injury at or during the Afterschool Program will be brought to the Program Director for necessary care, or if the injury appears serious, the child will remain at the scene of the injury and will be given first aid to avoid further injury or complication. The parent or guardian will be notified at the time of the injury or illness and given the option of picking up their child at that time. If not available, the child's physician and/or emergency contact will be notified. In the event of serious injury, emergency personnel (911) will be contacted.

### Discipline Policy
Children will be required to follow the same rules and responsibilities for conduct as outlined in the TCMS Student Handbook during the Afterschool Program. The discipline policy outlined in the Student Handbook will be followed in this program as well.

The Afterschool Program is a privilege and a convenience for our school families. Please note that if a student either enrolled in the program or as a drop-in is deemed to be a threat to themselves or another person associated with the program, or continually disrupts the program as it is intended and scheduled, that student and their family will lose the right to utilize the program. If a student is asked not to come back to the program, they may also lose their privilege of participating in afterschool activities, as the Afterschool Program is used for students who are not picked up immediately following the after school activity.

### Medication/Illness
The Afterschool Program will not dispense medication without written permission from the parent or legal guardian. If your child has a contagious condition (i.e. pink eye, lice, fever, rash, etc.) he/she will not be admitted into the program during that period. You will be required to pick up your child immediately. All medication must be in its original container with the child's name, doctor's name and dosage.

### Staff Transportation
The Afterschool staff is not authorized or allowed to transport children from the program to another location for any reason.

### Contacting the Program Director
If you need to contact the Program Director, please call 813-230-2630. This is the cell phone number that the Program Director will have at all times so you won't have to through the school office after dismissal of school.
