The 6th grade math program at TCMS is equivalent to an advanced 6th grade math program at any other public middle school in Hillsborough County. The curriculum focuses on 6 critical areas:

*   connecting ratio and rate to whole number multiplication and division and using concepts of ratio and rate to solve problems
*   completing understanding of division of fractions and extending the notion of number to the system of rational numbers, which includes negative numbers
*   writing, interpreting, and using expressions and equations
*   developing understanding of statistical thinking
*   developing understanding of and applying proportional relationships
*   developing understanding of operations with rational numbers and working with expressions and linear equations
