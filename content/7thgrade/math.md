Students in the 7th grade math classes at TCMS are enrolled in an advanced 7th grade math program. They are expected to work hard and begin to foster independent learning skills to help master the concepts presented in this class. The curriculum focuses on 5 critical areas:

* Solving problems involving scale drawings and informal geometric constructions, and working with two- and three-dimensional shapes to solve problems involving area, surface area, and volume.
* Drawing inferences about populations based on samples.
* Formulating and reasoning about expressions and equations, including modeling an association in bivariate data with a linear equation, and solving linear equations and systems of linear equations.
* Grasping the concept of a function and using functions to describe quantitative relationships.
* Analyzing two- and three-dimensional space and figures using distance, angle, similarity, and congruence, and understanding and applying the Pythagorean Theorem.
