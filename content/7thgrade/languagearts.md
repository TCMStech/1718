In grade 7, students will read five novels all of which will be studied as a whole class. Students will also have independent reading novels to read and use for writing activities throughout the schoolyear. Allstudentsareexpected to read chapters in the class novels for homework; however, some chapters will be read aloud in class and used for close reading activities. Students will work on writing to support claims in an analysis of a topic or text and continue the work began in 6th grade to achieve mastery in writing explanatory and argument essays. The final drafts of these papers must be typed and formatted correctly.

Students will continue to build upon the basic concepts of word study, including word structures (prefixes, roots & suffixes), grammar skills, and context clues. Vocabulary building will be incorporated into the curriculum through the novels and the 7th grade edition of the soft-text R.E.V. It Up. Students will also be working on developing stronger grade-level listening, speaking and viewing skills. This will mean working in groups, making speeches, listening respectfully and actively, and analyzing movies and other forms of multi-media.
