Parents of TCMS are resources for the school's administration and staff, thus the name Parent
Resource Association. The purpose of the PRA is to provide a strong parent base resource to
assist the school in whatever capacity as determined by the school's principal.
Whether you are new to TCMS or a long time parent, the PRA Board Members are here to
assist you in anyway we can.  If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, please do
not hesitate to call us. We want to hear from you!
