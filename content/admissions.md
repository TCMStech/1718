### Welcome to TCMS

Now in its nineteenth year, (2016-2017 school year), TCMS  has provided thousands of students in the Tampa Bay Area with an unparalleled education.   There is no greater compliment to those of us who have the privilege of working  here  that so many of our alumni return  to visit the faculty and staff and share with us that what they learned as students at TCMS more than prepared them for their high school and college educations. 

As you explore the many options that are available for your child’s middle school education, we ask that you consider TCMS because we believe, above all, that all children can learn.  We provide a safe and secure learning environment.  Our teachers are committed to providing the best instruction possible on a daily basis and are always available before school, during lunch and after school to offer tutoring for those students who seek additional help. 

TCMS has been recognized over the years for its strong back to basics academic program

Based on the 2015-2016 school year FSA results, our school was ranked first out of all the School District of Hillsborough County middle schools, and and fourth in the state of Florida.

We are so very proud of our Class of 2016.  Close to 40% of the 9th grade class at King IB (fall, 2016) was made up of our graduates.  We are also very proud of the other eighth graders who were accepted into various magnet programs or private high schools such as Jesuit and Tampa Catholic.

Because we believe in educating the whole child, there are numerous clubs and organizations that promote character development, teamwork and community service.    Students who participate on our extramural athletic teams have the opportunity to compete against other charter schools and private schools in the Tampa Bay area.  TCMS supports the arts and has a phenomenal band and chorus program that performs not only for the school community, but at events in the Tampa Bay area.  The list goes on…

The lottery for the 2016-2017 school year took place on Monday, February 15th at 4PM.  We again had a record amount of applications.

I sincerely hope that you will consider us for your child’s middle school education and please do not hesitate to contact me with questions.
