Students in the 8th grade math program at TCMS are taught the high school level Algebra I or Algebra I Honors curriculum. This rigorous, high school equivalent math course demands the best the student has to offer. Students must work hard at their grades each quarter and successfully pass a semester exam and the state End of Course Exam to qualify for a full high school credit. The Algebra curriculum focuses upon linear models, quadratic equations, exponential relationships, descriptive statistics, and polynomials. The Standards for Mathematical Practice apply throughout each course and, together with the content standards, prescribe that students experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and logical subject that makes use of their ability to make sense of problem situations.

Students will have many opportunities to express their problem solving abilities through writing, collaboration, and projects.

### High School Credit

Students in the 8th grade at TCMS are eligible for high school math credit. The requirements for a student to pass the first semester course are as follows:

The averaged letter grade for the first semester is based upon 70% from the first and second quarter averaged letter grade and 30% from the first semester exam. First semester credit is a prerequisite for second semester credit. Students must earn at least 3 quality points per semester.
Effective the 2011-2012 school year, a student enrolled in Algebra I for high school credit or Algebra I Honors for high school credit must pass the state End of Course Exam (EOC) administered in May. The EOC must be passed as determined by the state grading system for the student to earn their high school credit. It is possible that a student can pass the overall course, but not pass the EOC. That student would have to enroll in a summer make up EOC workshop or contact the high school where they will enroll in 9th grade to take the make-up exam offered the following December.

Algebra I or Algebra I H credit is a prerequisite for the International Baccalaureate program in the District. The student must successfully complete both semester one and two of the math class for credit in order to attend this program in high school.
