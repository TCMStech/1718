Eighth grade Language Arts students are expected to refine and extend all skills introduced in grades 6 and 7. Students will still spend at least 30 minutes each night on homework, reading or study for Language Arts. Parental support will continue to be critical to student success since students will need time to study and will need Internet access (at home or a local public library). In eighth grade, students will read a minimum of five novels. Students also refine their literary analysis skills and advance their study of poetic structure.

All students will be expected to craft and write strong explanatory and argument essays in grade 7 and continue with this essential skill in grade 8. Students will also work towards strengthening their persuasive writing skills to prepare for the “on-demand writing season,” as students must write for magnet, IB and preparatory school admissions. E Eighth grade students also complete an argument based, cross-curricular research paper. The final draft must be typed and correctly formatted MLA style.

Students will be expected to have mastered the basic concepts of word study, including word structures (prefixes, roots, and suffixes), grammar skills, and context clues. The workbook Grammar for Middle School: A sentence composing approach By Don and Jenny Killgallon is utilized. Vocabulary building will be incorporated into the curriculum through the 8th grade edition of the soft-text R.E.V. It Up. This in-class activity workbook provides relevant SAT vocabulary instruction through pictures and related critical thinking exercises. In addition, eighth grade Language Arts activities also include media productions in response to literature.

Within this curriculum students are expected and encouraged to master grade-level listening, speaking and viewing skills. This will mean collaborating in groups, making speeches, listening respectfully and actively, completing individual and group projects and analyzing movies and other genres of multi-media.

### Literacy Across the Curriculum

At TCMS, all teachers are committed to teaching literacy.  Teachers are required to receive reading training each year to add to their teaching techniques and to refresh their reading instruction skills.  In addition, all teachers are required to implement reading strategies during classroom instruction. The continued reinforcement of reading strategies provides continuity in the classroom and gives students strategies they can apply in all disciplines.

### Academic Support

All Language Arts teachers provide diagnostic testing in reading to students at the beginning of each year. Based on this diagnostic testing and/or prior year FSA English/Language Arts scores, students who demonstrate specific reading challenges are selected for the TCMS 7th period intensive tutoring program for individual/small group reading instruction once a week. These students are monitored by their tutor and, monthly, by their Grade Level Administrator. During Skills tutoring, the following reading strategies are reintroduced and reinforced to improve reading comprehension:

* Preview 
* Self-questioning 
* Making connections 
* Visualizing
* Knowing how words work 
* Monitoring Self-comprehension
* Summarizing main ideas 
* Evaluating 
* Building reading speed

Based on students' needs and interests, teachers utilize materials (fiction and non-fiction) into this tutoring program. In addition to after school tutoring, these students are provided extra help throughout the school day by TCMS academic tutors. These small groups meet every week in order to practice and reinforce basic skills.

Furthermore, in order to strengthen and implement advanced reading and writing skills, additional support for students is provided by all Language Arts teachers in every grade level before the regular school day.
