Students in the 8th grade science program at TCMS are taught the high school level Physical Science Honors Curriculum. This rigorous high school equivalent science course meets the requirements for graduation under the Florida Academic Scholars Program. This course is inquiry based and students are expected to build science knowledge by formulating questions, making predictions, conducting experiments, analyzing and interpreting data and drawing conclusions. Hands-on laboratory experiments are an integral part of this course. The main focus of the curriculum will be on the chemical and physical sciences including but not limited to: volume and mass, conservation of mass, characteristic properties of matter, mixtures, compounds and elements, the periodic table, radioactivity, force and motion, Newtonâ€™s Laws, energy and energy transfers, and waves.

### Physical Science Honors Credit

Quarters 1 and 2 will count for 75% and the semester exam will count for 25% of the overall semester grade. Second semester credit will be determined by using quarters 3 and 4 (75%) and the second semester exam score (25%). Students must earn 3 quality points each semester to earn HS credit (this includes the semester exam). Students are not permitted to change the level of their course once the school year has begun. Students who do not meet the requirements (at least 3 quality points) to receive high school credit will not have the option to move into a MJ3A Advanced 8th grade science course. The grades earned in Physical Science Honors will transfer with the student on their high school transcript if the student enrolls in a public high school and will affect the high school GPA.
