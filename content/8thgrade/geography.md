### Focus: Exploration through the Modern Era

In their last year at TCMS, students will begin their study of American History. At this level, students are introduced to the political, geographic, and the socioeconomic forces that have shaped our country. Students will also continue their education of American Civics, which will ultimately help prepare them for the roles and responsibilities required of every American citizen. To help bring this information to life, students will engage in debates, hear lectures, and perform reenactments of historical events. Eighth grade students will also focus on document based questioning, which will require them to read and comprehend a primary or secondary source and then extrapolate the larger historical meanings from the reading. Such skills will enable students to make a smooth transition to the high school AP or IB courses.

### Field Trips and Out of Classroom Experiences

In addition to the in-class curriculum, students will have the opportunity to participate in a truly amazing trip to Washington DC or Tallahassee. For those students going to our nationâ€™s capital, they will visit Fords Theater, the White House, and visit many important and historical monuments. Students will also participate in a culminating project which will require them to research the life of a fallen soldier. Thus, the students will not simply be visiting the Vietnam Memorial. Instead, such research will allow them to reflect on the personal sacrifices others have made, sacrifices that have made our country into what it is today. For students going to Tallahassee, they will tour the new and old capitol, participate in a community service project, visit the Florida Supreme Court, tour the Florida History Museum and visit Mission San Luis. Students will also do a culminating project which will enable them to synthesize the role the first permanent European settlement had in our history.
