For those students going to our nationâ€™s capital, they will visit Fords Theater, the White House, and visit many important and historical monuments. Students will also participate in a culminating project which will require them to research the life of a fallen soldier. Thus, the students will not simply be visiting the Vietnam Memorial. Instead, such research will allow them to reflect on the personal sacrifices others have made, sacrifices that have made our country into what it is today. For students going to Tallahassee, they will tour the new and old capitol, participate in a community service project, visit the Florida Supreme Court, tour the Florida History Museum and visit Mission San Luis. Students will also do a culminating project which will enable them to synthesize the role the first permanent European settlement had in our history.
