They are expected to work hard and begin to foster independent learning skills to help master the concepts presented in this class. The curriculum focuses on 5 critical areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Solving problems involving scale drawings and informal geometric constructions, and working with two- and three-dimensional shapes to solve problems involving area, surface area, and volume.</li>
<li>Drawing inferences about populations based on samples.</li>
<li>Formulating and reasoning about expressions and equations, including modeling an association in bivariate data with a linear equation, and solving linear equations and systems of linear equations.</li>
<li>Grasping the concept of a function and using functions to describe quantitative relationships.</li>
<li>Analyzing two- and three-dimensional space and figures using distance, angle, similarity, and congruence, and understanding and applying the Pythagorean Theorem.</li>
</ul>
