Students will also have independent reading novels to read and use for writing activities throughout the schoolyear. Allstudentsareexpected to read chapters in the class novels for homework; however, some chapters will be read aloud in class and used for close reading activities. Students will work on writing to support claims in an analysis of a topic or text and continue the work began in 6th grade to achieve mastery in writing explanatory and argument essays. The final drafts of these papers must be typed and formatted correctly.</p>

<p>Students will continue to build upon the basic concepts of word study, including word structures (prefixes, roots &amp; suffixes), grammar skills, and context clues. Vocabulary building will be incorporated into the curriculum through the novels and the 7th grade edition of the soft-text R.E.V. It Up. Students will also be working on developing stronger grade-level listening, speaking and viewing skills. This will mean working in groups, making speeches, listening respectfully and actively, and analyzing movies and other forms of multi-media.</p>

<p>Traditional seventh grade Language Arts units include</p>

<p>Reading and studying the classic novel, The Outsiders, by S.E. Hinton and examining the themes of divided communities, preserving childhood innocence, self-sacrifice, honor, and individual identity; Students will learn about actual events that took place during the Revolutionary War in the city of New York while reading Chains by Laurie Halse Anderson. This is a historical fiction novel in which the reader traces Isabel, the protagonist, and her struggles to undo the chains that bind her into slavery; A short story unit using class anthologies and online sources covering the elements of a story, figurative language, common themes and poetic devices; Learning about the use of allegory where an author takes an event in history and uses fictional characters to expose the truth behind our human existence. Students will be reading and studying the history of Stalin and the Russian Revolution alongside the reading of George Orwell’s novel, Animal Farm. This unit focuses on the different types of government, dangers of corruption with too much power, the use of propaganda, and intertwines with examining text carefully to discover author’s bias and point of view; A non-fiction unit will be introduced while reading Soul Surfer by Bethany Hamilton with Sheryl Berk and Rick Bundschuh. Students will be examining the themes of perseverance and learning how to move forward when an obstacle comes in your way. Students will also study how reading a firsthand account of an experience can have a powerful effect on the reader. Students will be introduced to the works of William Shakespeare by learning about his life, his famous sayings, sonnets and learning about the structure of a comedy while reading his wonderful, comedic play Much Ado About Nothing; Extensive units on Explanatory, Argument, and Narrative writing; Throughout the novel based curriculum, a strong emphasis is placed on non-fiction informational text as a supplement to each novel. Examples of these texts include editorials, feature articles, biographies, maps, manuals, instructions, political cartoons, etc. Much of the focus of the reading material is also cross-curricular with History content.</p>

<h3 id="focus-citizenship-and-civic-concepts">Focus: Citizenship and Civic Concepts</h3>

<p>In 7th grade, students begin their study of civics. It’s in this year that they will be introduced to laws, institutions, and Americana that form the backbone of our nation. Students will read, many for the first time, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and explore the ideas, passions, and motives that inspired our founders to put pen to paper and fight for their freedom. It is a freedom the generations long past and those yet unborn are charged with defending. It is our charge today and the reason why the state of Florida has mandated that all 7th graders become proficient in governance. Perhaps more than any other discipline, civics requires students to take an active role in their learning. Indeed, civics extends far beyond the constitution. It is on the streets of our cities, on the nightly news, in classrooms across American that our country’s path is debated and decided. As a result, students need to take part in this debate. In 7th grade for example, students will familiarize themselves with the question of immigration, formulate their ideas, and then be able to defend it with evidence. The path to citizenship begins in Social Studies. It begins by learn the history and understand the documents that created America. It begins by joining the greater discussion. In 7th grade, students learn what it means to be an American.</p>

<p>At the end of the course, students will take the Civics EOC exam. This exam will count for 30% of their Semester 2 grade.</p>
