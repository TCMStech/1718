Students master the content of areas such as biology and ecology in stimulating classroom, lab and field settings. Many tasks are in the form of science research and inquiry. Teachers also incorporate reading and writing skills into their classrooms with various labs, research projects and reports. The teachers have broken the curriculum into the following sections: Lab Safety and Scientific Method, Cells, Cell Cycle (Mitosis), Genetics, Taxonomy, Ecosystems, Food Webs and Chains, Evolution, Anatomy, and Organs. The 7th grade teachers cover these topics at an accelerated pace and teach for mastery. Students are expected to work hard, study every night and continue to foster independent learning skills to help master the concepts presented in this class.</p>
