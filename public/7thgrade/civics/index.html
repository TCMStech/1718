<h3 id="focus-citizenship-and-civic-concepts">Focus: Citizenship and Civic Concepts</h3>

<p>In 7th grade, students begin their study of civics. It’s in this year that they will be introduced to laws, institutions, and Americana that form the backbone of our nation. Students will read, many for the first time, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and explore the ideas, passions, and motives that inspired our founders to put pen to paper and fight for their freedom. It is a freedom the generations long past and those yet unborn are charged with defending. It is our charge today and the reason why the state of Florida has mandated that all 7th graders become proficient in governance. Perhaps more than any other discipline, civics requires students to take an active role in their learning. Indeed, civics extends far beyond the constitution. It is on the streets of our cities, on the nightly news, in classrooms across American that our country’s path is debated and decided. As a result, students need to take part in this debate. In 7th grade for example, students will familiarize themselves with the question of immigration, formulate their ideas, and then be able to defend it with evidence. The path to citizenship begins in Social Studies. It begins by learn the history and understand the documents that created America. It begins by joining the greater discussion. In 7th grade, students learn what it means to be an American.</p>

<p>At the end of the course, students will take the Civics EOC exam. This exam will count for 30% of their Semester 2 grade.</p>
