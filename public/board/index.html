                <p class="text-justify">
                Terrace Community Middle School is a non for profit public charter school. Years of work preceded the granting of our Charter on April 7, 1998.

 In 1994, a group of parents became concerned their children were not acquiring the skills necessary to succeed in high school, college, and the work place. This group was joined by an equally concerned group of teachers and business leaders in the community. An Advisory Board was established to determine the ideal way to achieve our goal. 

The goal was simple: Establish a school to teach all students to read critically, write coherently, and use numbers comfortably as tools. A modified Department of Defense Curriculum was chosen because it is a classic core curriculum designed to be implemented on a limited budget.

In January 1998, the Back-To-Basics Charter School Foundation, Inc. was incorporated and an administrative board was established. We were granted a charter three months later. The first year commenced in August 1998 with fifth through seventh grades. Eighth grade was added in the 1999-2000 school year which also marked our first graduating class.

We invite all parents and interested parties to attend the Board of Directors meetings on the second Wednesday of the month at 6 pm in Room 208.

Minutes of all Board meetings are available online. Please feel free to contact the Board of Directors with any questions you might have. We invite everyone to be an active participant in TCMS.
