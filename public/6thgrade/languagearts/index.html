<p>The transition to higher standards may take some getting used to for entering 6th grade students. On average, students will spend 30 minutes each night on homework, reading or studying for Language Arts. Parental support (time management &amp; organization) is often critical to student success since students will need time to study and will need regular Internet access (at home or a local public library). Also, many handouts will be needed for class and at times it will be the responsibility of the student to print the required materials at home. TCMS sixth grade students will read a minimum of four novels/anthology collection independently, in groups or as a whole class study. The literary genres covered include Science Fiction/Fantasy, Poetry, Folklore; Epics &amp; Mystery. All students are expected to read novels on their own time – not in class. Furthermore, they will be expected to begin working on writing explanatory and argument essays. The final drafts of these papers must be typed and formatted correctly.</p>

<p>Students will be introduced to the basic concepts of word study, including word structures (prefixes, roots &amp; suffixes), grammar skills, and context clues. Vocabulary building will be incorporated into the curriculum through the soft text R.E.V. It Up. Teachers also draw upon a variety of material, including the Prentice Hall Writing and Grammar Workbook as well as the Prentice Hall Literature text, Timeless Voices, Timeless Themes textbook. These texts provide direct and relevant vocabulary, writing, and grammar instruction through reading short stories and related critical thinking exercises. These stories and challenging exercises will encourage students to broaden their SAT vocabulary base and will allow students to continue to utilize reading comprehension and writing skills. Students are also expected to work towards mastering grade-level listening, speaking and viewing skills. This will mean working in groups, making speeches, listening respectfully and actively, and analyzing movies and other media forms.</p>
