&lt;h4 id=&#34;focus-geography-prehistory-ancient-history-through-the-middle-ages&#34;&gt;Focus: Geography/Prehistory/Ancient History through the Middle Ages&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 6th grade social studies curriculum focuses on ancient civilizations from prehistory through the Middle Ages. The students will be able to identify the 6 Essential Elements of Geography as well as how ideas and religion are spread. Students will also be able to articulate how social, economic, and political structures have influenced human history. Perhaps most important, students learn history by studying the lives of everyday people: their problems, their successes, and their preoccupations. Such an approach to historical pedagogy allows for some creative projects. For example, students will learn about Egyptian burial practices by performing their own mummification ceremony on frozen chickens. After their first year at TCMS, students will be well prepared for the challenges and discoveries that await them in 7th grade.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advanced Language Arts</title>

&lt;p&gt;The transition to higher standards may take some getting used to for entering 6th grade students. On average, students will spend 30 minutes each night on homework, reading or studying for Language Arts. Parental support (time management &amp;amp; organization) is often critical to student success since students will need time to study and will need regular Internet access (at home or a local public library). Also, many handouts will be needed for class and at times it will be the responsibility of the student to print the required materials at home. TCMS sixth grade students will read a minimum of four novels/anthology collection independently, in groups or as a whole class study. The literary genres covered include Science Fiction/Fantasy, Poetry, Folklore; Epics &amp;amp; Mystery. All students are expected to read novels on their own time – not in class. Furthermore, they will be expected to begin working on writing explanatory and argument essays. The final drafts of these papers must be typed and formatted correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students will be introduced to the basic concepts of word study, including word structures (prefixes, roots &amp;amp; suffixes), grammar skills, and context clues. Vocabulary building will be incorporated into the curriculum through the soft text R.E.V. It Up. Teachers also draw upon a variety of material, including the Prentice Hall Writing and Grammar Workbook as well as the Prentice Hall Literature text, Timeless Voices, Timeless Themes textbook. These texts provide direct and relevant vocabulary, writing, and grammar instruction through reading short stories and related critical thinking exercises. These stories and challenging exercises will encourage students to broaden their SAT vocabulary base and will allow students to continue to utilize reading comprehension and writing skills. Students are also expected to work towards mastering grade-level listening, speaking and viewing skills. This will mean working in groups, making speeches, listening respectfully and actively, and analyzing movies and other media forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional sixth grade language arts units include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;literature-reading&#34;&gt;Literature/Reading&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gathering Blue by Lois Lowry : supports the Science Fiction/Fantasy unit taught, skills covered: plot diagram, conflict types, protagonist/antagonist;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seedfolks by Paul Fleischman: skills covered: setting &amp;amp; mood, characterization, stereotypes, cross-curricular project with math;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black Ships Before Troy by Rosemary Sutcliff: skills covered: setting &amp;amp; mood, foreshadowing, symbolism, characterization;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin– mystery elements, characterization, setting &amp;amp; mood;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;writing&#34;&gt;Writing&lt;/h4&gt;
