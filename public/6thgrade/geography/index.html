<h4 id="focus-geography-prehistory-ancient-history-through-the-middle-ages">Focus: Geography/Prehistory/Ancient History through the Middle Ages</h4>

<p>The 6th grade social studies curriculum focuses on ancient civilizations from prehistory through the Middle Ages. The students will be able to identify the 6 Essential Elements of Geography as well as how ideas and religion are spread. Students will also be able to articulate how social, economic, and political structures have influenced human history. Perhaps most important, students learn history by studying the lives of everyday people: their problems, their successes, and their preoccupations. Such an approach to historical pedagogy allows for some creative projects. For example, students will learn about Egyptian burial practices by performing their own mummification ceremony on frozen chickens. After their first year at TCMS, students will be well prepared for the challenges and discoveries that await them in 7th grade.</p>
