<p>Eighth grade Language Arts students are expected to refine and extend all skills introduced in grades 6 and 7. Students will still spend at least 30 minutes each night on homework, reading or study for Language Arts. Parental support will continue to be critical to student success since students will need time to study and will need Internet access (at home or a local public library). In eighth grade, students will read a minimum of five novels. Students also refine their literary analysis skills and advance their study of poetic structure.</p>

<p>All students will be expected to craft and write strong explanatory and argument essays in grade 7 and continue with this essential skill in grade 8. Students will also work towards strengthening their persuasive writing skills to prepare for the “on-demand writing season,” as students must write for magnet, IB and preparatory school admissions. E Eighth grade students also complete an argument based, cross-curricular research paper. The final draft must be typed and correctly formatted MLA style.</p>

<p>Students will be expected to have mastered the basic concepts of word study, including word structures (prefixes, roots, and suffixes), grammar skills, and context clues. The workbook Grammar for Middle School: A sentence composing approach By Don and Jenny Killgallon is utilized. Vocabulary building will be incorporated into the curriculum through the 8th grade edition of the soft-text R.E.V. It Up. This in-class activity workbook provides relevant SAT vocabulary instruction through pictures and related critical thinking exercises. In addition, eighth grade Language Arts activities also include media productions in response to literature.</p>

<p>Within this curriculum students are expected and encouraged to master grade-level listening, speaking and viewing skills. This will mean collaborating in groups, making speeches, listening respectfully and actively, completing individual and group projects and analyzing movies and other genres of multi-media.</p>

<p>Traditional eighth grade Language Arts units include:</p>

<h3 id="literacy-across-the-curriculum">Literacy Across the Curriculum</h3>

<p>At TCMS, all teachers are committed to teaching literacy.  Teachers are required to receive reading training each year to add to their teaching techniques and to refresh their reading instruction skills.  In addition, all teachers are required to implement reading strategies during classroom instruction. The continued reinforcement of reading strategies provides continuity in the classroom and gives students strategies they can apply in all disciplines.</p>

<h3 id="academic-support">Academic Support</h3>

<p>All Language Arts teachers provide diagnostic testing in reading to students at the beginning of each year. Based on this diagnostic testing and/or prior year FSA English/Language Arts scores, students who demonstrate specific reading challenges are selected for the TCMS 7th period intensive tutoring program for individual/small group reading instruction once a week. These students are monitored by their tutor and, monthly, by their Grade Level Administrator. During Skills tutoring, the following reading strategies are reintroduced and reinforced to improve reading comprehension:</p>

<ul>
<li>Preview</li>
<li>Self-questioning</li>
<li>Making connections</li>
<li>Visualizing</li>
<li>Knowing how words work</li>
<li>Monitoring Self-comprehension</li>
<li>Summarizing main ideas</li>
<li>Evaluating</li>
<li>Building reading speed</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on students&rsquo; needs and interests, teachers utilize materials (fiction and non-fiction) into this tutoring program. In addition to after school tutoring, these students are provided extra help throughout the school day by TCMS academic tutors. These small groups meet every week in order to practice and reinforce basic skills.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in order to strengthen and implement advanced reading and writing skills, additional support for students is provided by all Language Arts teachers in every grade level before the regular school day.</p>

<p>Students in the 8th grade math program at TCMS are taught the high school level Algebra I or Algebra I Honors curriculum. This rigorous, high school equivalent math course demands the best the student has to offer. Students must work hard at their grades each quarter and successfully pass a semester exam and the state End of Course Exam to qualify for a full high school credit. The Algebra curriculum focuses upon linear models, quadratic equations, exponential relationships, descriptive statistics, and polynomials. The Standards for Mathematical Practice apply throughout each course and, together with the content standards, prescribe that students experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and logical subject that makes use of their ability to make sense of problem situations.</p>

<p>Students will have many opportunities to express their problem solving abilities through writing, collaboration, and projects.</p>

<h3 id="high-school-credit">High School Credit</h3>

<p>Students in the 8th grade at TCMS are eligible for high school math credit. The requirements for a student to pass the first semester course are as follows:</p>

<p>The averaged letter grade for the first semester is based upon 70% from the first and second quarter averaged letter grade and 30% from the first semester exam. First semester credit is a prerequisite for second semester credit. Students must earn at least 3 quality points per semester.
Effective the 2011-2012 school year, a student enrolled in Algebra I for high school credit or Algebra I Honors for high school credit must pass the state End of Course Exam (EOC) administered in May. The EOC must be passed as determined by the state grading system for the student to earn their high school credit. It is possible that a student can pass the overall course, but not pass the EOC. That student would have to enroll in a summer make up EOC workshop or contact the high school where they will enroll in 9th grade to take the make-up exam offered the following December.</p>

<p>Algebra I or Algebra I H credit is a prerequisite for the International Baccalaureate program in the District. The student must successfully complete both semester one and two of the math class for credit in order to attend this program in high school.</p>

<p>Students in the 8th grade science program at TCMS are taught the high school level Physical Science Honors Curriculum. This rigorous high school equivalent science course meets the requirements for graduation under the Florida Academic Scholars Program. This course is inquiry based and students are expected to build science knowledge by formulating questions, making predictions, conducting experiments, analyzing and interpreting data and drawing conclusions. Hands-on laboratory experiments are an integral part of this course. The main focus of the curriculum will be on the chemical and physical sciences including but not limited to: volume and mass, conservation of mass, characteristic properties of matter, mixtures, compounds and elements, the periodic table, radioactivity, force and motion, Newton’s Laws, energy and energy transfers, and waves.</p>

<h3 id="physical-science-honors-credit">Physical Science Honors Credit</h3>

<p>Quarters 1 and 2 will count for 75% and the semester exam will count for 25% of the overall semester grade. Second semester credit will be determined by using quarters 3 and 4 (75%) and the second semester exam score (25%). Students must earn 3 quality points each semester to earn HS credit (this includes the semester exam). Students are not permitted to change the level of their course once the school year has begun. Students who do not meet the requirements (at least 3 quality points) to receive high school credit will not have the option to move into a MJ3A Advanced 8th grade science course. The grades earned in Physical Science Honors will transfer with the student on their high school transcript if the student enrolls in a public high school and will affect the high school GPA.</p>

<h3 id="focus-exploration-through-the-modern-era">Focus: Exploration through the Modern Era</h3>

<p>In their last year at TCMS, students will begin their study of American History. At this level, students are introduced to the political, geographic, and the socioeconomic forces that have shaped our country. Students will also continue their education of American Civics, which will ultimately help prepare them for the roles and responsibilities required of every American citizen. To help bring this information to life, students will engage in debates, hear lectures, and perform reenactments of historical events. Eighth grade students will also focus on document based questioning, which will require them to read and comprehend a primary or secondary source and then extrapolate the larger historical meanings from the reading. Such skills will enable students to make a smooth transition to the high school AP or IB courses.</p>

<h3 id="field-trips-and-out-of-classroom-experiences">Field Trips and Out of Classroom Experiences</h3>

<p>In addition to the in-class curriculum, students will have the opportunity to participate in a truly amazing trip to Washington DC or Tallahassee. For those students going to our nation’s capital, they will visit Fords Theater, the White House, and visit many important and historical monuments. Students will also participate in a culminating project which will require them to research the life of a fallen soldier. Thus, the students will not simply be visiting the Vietnam Memorial. Instead, such research will allow them to reflect on the personal sacrifices others have made, sacrifices that have made our country into what it is today. For students going to Tallahassee, they will tour the new and old capitol, participate in a community service project, visit the Florida Supreme Court, tour the Florida History Museum and visit Mission San Luis. Students will also do a culminating project which will enable them to synthesize the role the first permanent European settlement had in our history.</p>
